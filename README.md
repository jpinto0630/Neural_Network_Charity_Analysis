# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

We are tasked with assisting a friend, Beks, in utilizing a neural network model that is capable of predicting wether a charity applicant will be sucessful in attaining funding. 

## Results

### Data Preprocessing

- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
    ``` IS_SUCCESSFUL ```
- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
    ```STATUS, ASK_AMT, APPLICATION_TYPE_Other, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT ```
- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
  ``` EIN, NAME ```

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

```
Neurons: 110
Layers: 2
Activation Functions: Sigmoid

```

- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

``` No the model was not able to achieve the target model performance. ```

- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

``` 
The following could be used to increase model performance: 
Adjusting the input data
Adding more Neurons
Adding more layers
Utilizing different activation Functions
Tinkering with the number of epochs in the training  
```
